# Reverse proxy example configuration
#
# Notes:
# - Durations use Go's time.ParseDuration format (e.g. "10s", "5m", "24h").
# - Backend `health_url` may be absolute (https://host/health) or a relative path ("/health").
#   If relative, it will be joined to the backend `url` (trim-righting any trailing slash).
# - The names of keys must match the config struct tags in the code.
#
# Before running, ensure this file is loaded by your binary (e.g. via -config or env-driven loader).

proxy:
  # Host/port the proxy listens on for client traffic
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: "8080"

  # Port to expose liveness/readiness probes (separate from main listen port)
  probe_port: "8085"

  # Default TTL used when no explicit cache headers found
  # Example: 5m (5 minutes)
  default_ttl: 5m

  # Maximum allowed TTL for any cached entry
  # Example: 24h (24 hours)
  max_age: 24h

cache:
  # Disable caching entirely
  disabled: false

  # How frequently the in-memory cache should purge expired entries
  # Example: 10m (10 minutes)
  purge_interval: 10m

load_balancer:
  # Type of load balancing to use. Supported values:
  # - "round-robin" (default)
  # - "weighted-round-robin" (uses per-backend `weight`)
  # - "least-connections" (requires connection tracking)
  type: "round-robin"

  pool:
    # Health checker configuration
    health_checker:
      # How often to run health checks against each backend
      # Example: 10s
      interval: 10s

      # How long to wait for a health check response before considering it a timeout
      # Example: 2s
      timeout: 2s

      # Maximum number of concurrent health checks
      # Example: 5
      max_concurrent_checks: 5

    # Backend pool configuration - list of backends to load balance
    backends:
      - name: "backend-1"
        url: "http://localhost:8081"
        # health_url can be absolute or relative (e.g. "/health")
        # If omitted, defaults to <url>/health
        health_url: "/health"
        weight: 1
        max_conns: 100

      - name: "backend-2"
        url: "http://localhost:8082"
        # absolute health check URL
        health_url: "http://localhost:8082/health"
        weight: 1
        max_conns: 100

      - name: "backend-3"
        url: "http://10.0.0.5:8080"
        # health_url omitted -> will be computed as "<url>/health"
        weight: 2
        max_conns: 200

rate_limiter:
  # Type of rate limiting to use
  # Supported values: "per-ip" (default)
  type: "per-ip"

  # Requests per second limit
  limit: 100

  # List of IPs to trust for X-Forwarded-For headers
  # If client IP is in this list, use the X-Forwarded-For value instead
  trusted_proxies:
    - "127.0.0.1"
    - "::1"
    # Add your reverse proxy IPs if running behind another proxy
    # - "10.0.0.0/8"

# Configuration Notes and Best Practices:
#
# Proxy Configuration:
#   - host: Bind address ("0.0.0.0" for all interfaces, "127.0.0.1" for localhost only)
#   - port: Main proxy port
#   - probe_port: Separate port for health/readiness probes
#   - default_ttl: Cache TTL when backend has no Cache-Control header
#   - max_age: Maximum cache duration regardless of backend headers
#
# Cache Configuration:
#   - disabled: Set to true to completely disable caching (useful for testing)
#   - purge_interval: How often to clean up expired entries from memory
#
# Load Balancer Configuration:
#   - type: Algorithm for selecting backends
#     * "round-robin": Simple round-robin distribution
#     * "weighted-round-robin": Uses weight field (1-100 typical)
#     * "least-connections": Selects backend with fewest active connections
#
# Pool Configuration:
#   - health_checker.interval: Check interval (10s recommended)
#   - health_checker.timeout: Response timeout (2s recommended)
#   - health_checker.max_concurrent_checks: Parallel checks (5+ recommended)
#
# Backend Configuration:
#   - url: Base URL of the backend service
#   - health_url: Path to health check endpoint (relative or absolute)
#   - weight: Importance in weighted balancing (1-100)
#   - max_conns: Maximum simultaneous connections allowed
#
# Rate Limiter Configuration:
#   - type: Limiting strategy
#   - limit: Requests per second per IP (adjust based on backend capacity)
#   - trusted_proxies: IPs to trust for X-Forwarded-For header
